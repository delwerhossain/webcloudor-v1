Cookies are small text files that websites store on your device when you visit them. 
Think of them as digital Post-it notes that help websites remember information 
about your visit, such as your preferences and settings.

Cookies cannot:
• Access your personal files or install software
• Contain viruses or malicious code
• Directly identify you as a person
• Access information from other websites

Cookies can:
• Remember your preferences and settings
• Improve website performance and functionality

**Persistent Cookies**
