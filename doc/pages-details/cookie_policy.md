Cookies are small text files that websites store on your device when you visit them. 
Think of them as digital Post-it notes that help websites remember information 
about your visit, such as your preferences and settings.

Cookies cannot:
‚Ä¢ Access your personal files or install software
‚Ä¢ Contain viruses or malicious code
‚Ä¢ Directly identify you as a person
‚Ä¢ Access information from other websites

Cookies can:
‚Ä¢ Remember your preferences and settings
‚Ä¢ Improve website performance and functionality
