# 🚀 Sanity CMS Content Setup Guide

## 📋 Current Status

✅ **Sanity CMS is fully configured and working**  
✅ **All schemas are properly defined**  
✅ **Environment variables are correctly set**  
✅ **Blog page has graceful fallback to mock data**  
❌ **API token expired/unauthorized for write operations**  
❌ **Dataset is empty (no content created yet)**

## 🎯 Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Sanity Studio (Recommended)

**Easiest approach - No API token issues**

1. **Start your development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Access Sanity Studio:**
   - Open: `http://localhost:3000/studio`
   - This bypasses API token issues as it uses browser auth

3. **Create content in this order:**

   - "Cloud Architecture Best Practices for Modern Applications"  
   - "AI Integration in Web Applications: A Practical Guide"

### Option 2: Fix API Token & Run Script

**For programmatic content creation**

1. **Get new API token:**
   - Go to [Sanity Dashboard](https://sanity.io/manage)
   - Select your project: `ykitcdzv`
   - Go to API → Tokens
   - Create new token with Editor permissions
   - Copy the new token

2. **Update environment variables:**
   ```env
   SANITY_API_TOKEN=your-new-token-here
   ```

3. **Run the population script:**
   ```bash
   npm run sanity:populate
   ```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Studio doesn't load:
```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### If API token still doesn't work:
1. Make sure token has "Editor" or "Admin" permissions
2. Verify project ID matches: `ykitcdzv`
3. Check dataset is: `production`

### If blog page still shows mock data:
1. Wait 1-2 minutes after creating content (CDN cache)
2. Hard refresh the blog page (Ctrl+F5)
3. Check browser console for errors

## ✅ Verification Steps

1. **Check content exists:**
   - Visit `/studio` and see your content
   - Content should show "Published" status

2. **Test blog page:**
   - Visit `/blog` 
   - Should show real Sanity data instead of mock data
   - Check browser console - should see "✅ Sanity connection successful!"

3. **Check API endpoints:**
   ```bash
   # Test if data is accessible
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/blog
   ```

## 🎉 Expected Results

After adding content, your blog page will:
- ✅ Display real Sanity content instead of mock data
- ✅ Show proper author information and avatars
- ✅ Have working category filtering
- ✅ Display featured posts correctly
- ✅ Have proper SEO metadata
- ✅ Support search functionality

The mock data fallback will still work as a safety net if Sanity becomes unavailable.
